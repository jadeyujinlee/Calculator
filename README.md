# Calculator

This project is an exercise in the mechanics of postfix arithmetic. The calculator solves arithmetic problems using the shunting-yard algorithm. The calculator takes in both postfix and infix notation. 

This assignment was a lot of practice in using stack data structures when used in a real parsing application! 

The files Tokenization.java and Postfix.java are starter code written by Professor Nicholas Howe of Smith College.
